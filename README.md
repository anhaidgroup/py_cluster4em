# py_cluster4em
py_cluster4em is a Python package for performing clustering. 
It provides different clustering approaches that you could take to generate clusters out of a matches file. 

As an example, you could output clusters out of the below given matches file sample:\
*insert example here*

## How to use:
You could call the script as follows:
```python py_cluster4em.py matches.csv leftIdColumnName rightIdColumnName floatThreshold output_liberal.json output_conservative.json```\
where\
*matches.csv*: Name of the csv file containing the matches.\
*leftIdColumnName*: Name of the column containing the left side of the matching ids.\
*rightIdColumnName*: Name of the column containing the right side of the matching ids.\
*floatThreshold*: A decimal number representing the threshold parameter.\
*output_liberal.json, output_conservative.json*: File names to store the output of liberal and conservative approaches respectively.

## Types of clustering approaches supported:
All clustering approaches assume a graph representation of matches where nodes are the different ids and the labelled edges represent a match between the two with a certain score(label).\
1. Liberal Clustering:  
This type of clustering means making the clusters out of the connected components in the matches graph.

2. Conservative Clustering:
This type of clustering makes the clusters out of the maximal cliques in the matches graph.
